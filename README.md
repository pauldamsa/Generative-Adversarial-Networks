# Generative-Adversarial-Networks
This repository will show my algorithm of GANs( Generative Adversarial Networks) in Python.
I couldn't upload the train dataset, because it is too big. In these photo you will see how the algorithm can generate photos better and better, epoch after epoch. You should run this algorithm only if you have a very good system with a Nvidia GPU and obviously with CUDA installed.
You can find the dataset here https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
